# Ratio Simplifier

This web application simplifies mathematical ratios while allowing for potential losses. Built with React and Redux Toolkit, it provides users with an intuitive platform to input parameters such as height, width, and permissible loss percentage, resulting in simplified ratios.

A live deployment of this project can be found [here](https://makandrr.github.io/ratio-simplifier).

## Features

- Input height, width, and permissible loss percentage.
- Calculate simplified ratios with potential losses.
- Visualization of the ratio as a rectangle

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makandrr/ratio-simplifier
```

2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd ratio-simplifier
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to view the app

## Usage

- Enter the desired height, width, and permissible loss percentage in the input fields.
- View the simplified ratio as two numbers and represented as a rectangle.
- Modify the inputs as needed to observe changes in the simplified ratios.
